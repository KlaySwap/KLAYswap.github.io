    "EventTip1Title": "What is KLAYswap? ",
    "EventTip1Article": "KLAYswap is a decentralized financial service designed for holders of various cryptocurrency to better utilize their assets to create additional income, hosted on Klaytn chain.  Klaytn chain is the blockchain of Ground X, a subsidiary of Kakao.  Ground X is the forerunner in Korean DeFi ecosystem with Klip, a Kakao-based blockchain wallet, as well as Klaystation, where Klaytn assets can be deposited and used for staking.<br />\n\nDecentralization means that users have full control over their assets, from depositing to withdrawal to blockchain wallets, as well as private keys that allow actions over the assets.  All of this is done, without signing up for service or without having to provide personal information. <br />\n\nAll financial activities that take place in KLAYswap are recorded on the blockchain ledger, and managed transparently. <br />\n\nWith this transparency, users of KLAYswap can not only exchange their digital assets, but use the assets they own on Klaytn, Ripple, Ethereum and BSC to utilize in a variety of decentralized services such as using financial products or staking.<br />\n",
    "EventTip2Title": "What are KLAY & <br />KLAYswap (KSP) tokens? ",
    "EventTip2Article": "KLAY token is the native digital asset of Klaytn chain.  It can be used to participate in various financial products within KLAYswap, and can be deposited to or withdrawn from Klaytn wallet, to be staked or exchanged. <br />\n\nKLAYswap Protocol (KSP) token is a governance token, used to vote on important issues of a system, such as choosing KSP reward rate on each pool, or changing the swap rate. <br />\n\nKSP is distributed to Liquidity Providers as a reward for being part of KLAYswap ecosystem, and the KSP received can be traded, or used in KSP staking or Voting for additional rewards.<br />\n",
    "EventTip3Title": "What is Liquidity Pool? ",
    "EventTip3Article": "For users wishing to exchange some of their Ripple assets to Ethereum, one way for them to do so is through a centralized exchange.  This means they need to register their intent to buy Ethereum, and wait until someone appears that wishes to sell at that price.<br />\n\nThis requires that someone to have enough Ethereum for the transaction to complete fully.  In other words, there needs to be enough ‘liquidity’ for users to trade their digital assets.  ‘Liquidity’ is the term used to describe how easily tradable an asset is.\n\nA good liquidity is essential for convenient digital asset trading, and in the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), smart contract-based asset pools with large amount of digital assets are used to address this issue.  KLAYswap is no different. <br />\n",
    "EventTip4Title": "How does depositing<br /> to Liquidity Pool work?",
    "EventTip4Article": "In a Liquidity Pool, two distinct digital assets can be deposited in a pair. This is done securely through a smart contract, and the paired asset becomes part of what is known as a \"Liquidity Pool”.<br />\n\n1. We refer to users who deposit assets into these pools Liquidity Provider, or LP for short. If for example a Ripple+Ethereum pool exists, anyone can become a LP by depositing these assets into the pool.<br />\n\n2. At the time of depositing, the assets are deposited in such way that both assets are of equal fiat value as per the price at the moment of transaction.  For example, let’s assume the price of Ripple is $2.0, and Ethereum $4,000 at the time of transaction.  So if an user was to deposit 100 XRP, he or she would need to deposit an amount of Ethereum with same value, which is 0.05 ETH.  The prices fetched at this moment does not stem from an outside exchange, but by the prices and ratio between those two assets within KLAYswap. <br />\n\n3. After depositing is finished, rewards are accumulated by the seconds.  Assets in the pool can be withdrawn at any given moment. <br />\n",
    "EventTip5Title": "Why should I use KLAYswap? ",
    "EventTip5Article": "Liquidity Providers, for their contributions to the pools, are rewarded depending on the amount of contributions.  If you have contributed to assets in Ripple + Ethereum pool, you are eligible to receive a part of fee generated by users of that pool, and are rewarded KSP depending on how much of the pool you have contributed by. <br />\n\nFor holders of digital assets that believe in the future of a certain asset, Liquidity Pool can be an effective way of investing. \nIf an asset is held at an exchange or a personal wallet, only the change in price would drive profitability, while assets held in a Liquidity Pool would also generate additional profit. <br />\n",
    "EventTip6Title": "How can rewards be utilized? ",
    "EventTip6Article": "The transaction fees collected from the deposited pool is automatically collected, then distributed among the Liquidity Providers.  The KSP reward collected can be used for (~), but for more effective ways of utilizing the reward, the user may: <br />\n\n1. Deposit the KSP to a pair containing KSP.  The KSP collected can be paired with other assets such as Klaytn(KLAY), Ripple(XRP), Ethereum(ETH), Wrapped BTC(WBTC) to receive even more KSP rewards.<br />\n\n2. Participate in KSP staking.  The KSP collected can be locked for certain periods of time, and user is rewarded additional KSP for contributing to the stability of governance token.  By doing so the user receives rewards, as well as pool voting rights.  The reward rate of each pool in KLAYswap is decided entirely by the users of voting rights.<br />\n\n3. Earn additional reward by participating in Pool Voting.  This generates additional rewards from the voted pools.  Transaction fees generated from pools are distributed to Liquidity Providers and voters 50:50. <br />\n",
